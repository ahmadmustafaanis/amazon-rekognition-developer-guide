# Giving Amazon Rekognition Video access to your resources<a name="api-streaming-video-roles"></a>

You use an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service role to give Amazon Rekognition Video read access to Kinesis video streams\. If you are using a face search stream processor, you use an IAM service role to give Amazon Rekognition Video write access to Kinesis data streams\. If you are using a security monitoring stream processor, you use IAM roles to give Amazon Rekognition Video access to your Amazon S3 bucket and to an Amazon SNS topic\.

## Giving access for face search stream processors<a name="api-streaming-video-roles-single-stream"></a>

You can create a permissions policy that allows Amazon Rekognition Video access to individual Kinesis video streams and Kinesis data streams\.

**To give Amazon Rekognition Video access for a face search stream processor**

1. [ Create a new permissions policy with the IAM JSON policy editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-json-editor), and use the following policy\. Replace `video-arn` with the ARN of the desired Kinesis video stream\. If you are using a face search stream processor, replace `data-arn` with the ARN of the desired Kinesis data stream\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "kinesis:PutRecord",
                   "kinesis:PutRecords"
               ],
               "Resource": "data-arn"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "kinesisvideo:GetDataEndpoint",
                   "kinesisvideo:GetMedia"
               ],
               "Resource": "video-arn"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. [Create an IAM service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console), or update an existing IAM service role\. Use the following information to create the IAM service role:

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service name\.

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service role use case\.

   1. Attach the permissions policy that you created in step 1\.

1. Note the ARN of the service role\. You need it to start video analysis operations\.

## Giving access to streams using AmazonRekognitionServiceRole<a name="api-streaming-video-roles-all-stream"></a>

 As an alternative option for setting up access to Kinesis video streams and data streams, you can use the `AmazonRekognitionServiceRole` permissions policy\. IAM provides the *Rekognition* service role use case that, when used with the `AmazonRekognitionServiceRole` permissions policy, can write to multiple Kinesis data streams and read from all your Kinesis video streams\. To give Amazon Rekognition Video write access to multiple Kinesis data streams, you can prepend the names of the Kinesis data streams with *AmazonRekognition*â€”for example, `AmazonRekognitionMyDataStreamName`\. 

**To give Amazon Rekognition Video access to your Kinesis video stream and Kinesis data stream**

1. [Create an IAM service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console)\. Use the following information to create the IAM service role:

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service name\.

   1. Choose **Rekognition** for the service role use case\.

   1. Choose the **AmazonRekognitionServiceRole** permissions policy, which gives Amazon Rekognition Video write access to Kinesis data streams that are prefixed with *AmazonRekognition* and read access to all your Kinesis video streams\.

1. To ensure your account is secure, limit the scope of Rekognition's access to just the resources you are using\. This can be done by attaching a trust policy to your IAM service role\. For information on how to do this, see [Cross\-service confused deputy prevention](cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.md)\.

1. Note the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the service role\. You need it to start video analysis operations\.

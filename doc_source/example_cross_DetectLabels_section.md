# Save EXIF and other image information using an AWS SDK<a name="example_cross_DetectLabels_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to:
+ Get EXIF information from a a JPG, JPEG, or PNG file\.
+ Upload the image file to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\.
+ Use Amazon Rekognition \(Amazon Rekognition\) to identify the three top attributes \(labels in Amazon Rekognition\) in the file\.
+ Add the EXIF and label information to a Amazon DynamoDB \(DynamoDB\) table in the Region\.
